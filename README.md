## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up API credentials:
   - For Edamam API:
     - Sign up for a free account at [Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com/)
     - Create a new application to get your App ID and App Key
     - Replace `YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_ID` and `YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_KEY` in `src/services/api.ts` with your actual credentials
   - For USDA API:
     - The app uses a demo key by default (`DEMO_KEY`)
     - For production use, get your own API key from [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html)
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Troubleshooting

If the food search functionality is not working:

1. **Check API Credentials**: Ensure you have correctly set your Edamam App ID and App Key in `src/services/api.ts`
2. **Check Network Connection**: Verify that your development server can access the internet
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages in the browser's developer console
4. **Edamam API Limits**: The free plan has rate limits. If you've exceeded them, you may need to wait or upgrade your plan
